# Softgames GameDev Test

A PixiJS-based game development project implementing three game demos for a SoftGames technical test.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (JavaScript runtime and package manager)

### Installation

```bash
# (*At the location where you placed the repository*)
# Install dependencies
bun install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
bun run dev
```

This will start a local development server. The application will automatically reload when you make changes.

## Project Structure

- `/src/engine/` - Core engine functionality and utilities
- `/src/app/screens/` - Individual game screens (Screen 1-3)
- `/src/app/features/` - Shared game features (e.g., chat system)
- `/src/fire/` - Fire effect implementation
- `/src/anime/` - Animation utilities and presets

## Requirements

- Write your code in TypeScript and use pixi.js (v7) for rendering.
- Each task should be accessed via an in-game menu.
- Render responsively for both mobile and desktop devices.
- Display the fps in the top left corner.
- Run the application in full screen.

the animation of the movement should take 2 seconds
